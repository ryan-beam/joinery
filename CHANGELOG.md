## [Unreleased]

### Added — `workshop adopt`

Mid-project adoption command for installing the framework into an existing codebase. Where `init` requires an empty target and scaffolds a fresh project, `adopt` overlays Joinery onto whatever is already there:

- `workshop adopt [--tier T] [--lang L] [--path P] [--force] [--no-hooks]` — runs in the current directory by default
- **Non-destructive by default.** Existing files (`README.md`, prior `CLAUDE.md`, etc.) are preserved and reported, not overwritten. `--force` opts into overwriting framework files.
- **Refuses re-adoption.** If `.workshop/tier.lock` already exists, the command exits with a clear error message unless `--force` is passed.
- **Does not auto-commit.** Files are written to the working tree; the user reviews the diff and stages them through their normal git workflow.
- **Handles non-git targets.** Adopts framework files but skips hook installation, with a printed note explaining how to install hooks after `git init`.
- Project name is derived from the target directory's name; language auto-detected from existing files (Python / TypeScript / polyglot) with a fallback to `polyglot` when nothing matches.

### Changed — `init.py` refactor (internal)

`scaffold()` now composes six module-level helpers (`write_project_files`, `write_learning_module`, `write_tier_adr`, `write_workshop_state`, `install_skills`, `install_hooks_into`) instead of inlining the file-laying logic. The same helpers back `adopt()` with `skip_existing=True`. Public API unchanged — `scaffold()` signature and return type are identical. `copy_template` and `copy_tree` in `templates.py` gain an optional `skip_existing=False` keyword for the same purpose.

### Added — answer file `.workshop/answers.toml`

Every `workshop init` and `workshop adopt` now writes a tracked answer file recording what Joinery installed in the project. This is the foundation for future `workshop diff` / `workshop update` / `workshop migrate` flows — without it, Joinery has no durable memory of which files in your repo it manages.

The file is plain TOML:

```toml
joinery_version = "0.1.x"
mode = "adopt"          # or "init"
tier = "production"
language = "python"
project_name = "my-app"
created_at = "2026-05-11T..."

[files]
managed = ["CLAUDE.md", "plan.md", ...]
preserved = ["README.md", ...]  # adopt only — files Joinery skipped

[hooks]
installed = ["pre-commit", "pre-push", ...]
preserved = []
```

New module: `src/joinery/manifest.py` with `Manifest` dataclass + `read_manifest()` / `write_manifest()`. Hand-written TOML serializer (the schema is small and fixed) — no new dependencies. Stdlib `tomllib` for reads (Python 3.11+).

### Added — `managed-by` markers in rendered templates

Files Joinery writes now carry a `<!-- managed-by: joinery@VERSION -->` HTML comment at the top (hidden in rendered markdown). Applied to CLAUDE.md, plan.md, AGENTS.md, HANDOVER.md, README.md, the learning module, and the tier-selection ADR. The marker is informational for v0.1.x; future update flows will use it together with the answer file to distinguish framework-managed files from user-edited ones.

### Added — pre-adopt safety scan + hook backup

`workshop adopt` now runs a safety scan before writing anything. The scan inspects the target for conditions that make adoption risky:

- **Dirty working tree** — refuses adoption (ERROR) so the resulting diff is reviewable. Bypass with `--allow-dirty`.
- **Sensitive paths** like `.env`, `.env.*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `credentials.json`, `.aws/`, `.ssh/`, `secrets/`, `id_rsa`, `id_ed25519` — surfaces them as warnings so the user knows what Joinery's new hooks might encounter.
- **Alternative hook managers** like husky, lefthook, the pre-commit framework — warns that Joinery's hooks may chain awkwardly with theirs.
- **Existing git hooks** — notes that they will be backed up to `.joinery/backup/hooks-<timestamp>/` before Joinery installs its own.

The scan is run in addition to existing checks (empty target, already-adopted). Errors halt adoption unless overridden; warnings/info are surfaced in the summary but do not block. New CLI flags:

- `--allow-dirty` — bypass the dirty-tree check
- `--no-scan` — skip the entire scan (escape hatch for CI / recovery)

Hook backup is always non-destructive. Existing non-`.sample` files in `.git/hooks/` are copied to `.joinery/backup/hooks-YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ/` before Joinery installs its own. The backup path is returned in `AdoptResult.hooks_backup` and printed in the adoption summary.

New module `src/joinery/preadopt.py` with `PreAdoptReport` dataclass, `UnsafeAdoptError`, `scan()`, and `backup_hooks()`. 16 new unit tests in `tests/test_preadopt.py`; 5 new integration tests in `tests/test_adopt.py` covering dirty-tree refusal, `--allow-dirty` bypass, `--no-scan` bypass, hook backup, and sensitive-path warnings.

### Added — `--dry-run` flag + transaction log + `workshop rollback`

Three changes that together give Joinery a full preview/audit/undo loop on top of `init` and `adopt`:

- **`--dry-run` on `init` and `adopt`** — previews exactly what would be written without touching the filesystem. The pre-adopt safety scan still runs (read-only). The return value reflects what would have happened so callers can show a diff. No git operations, no manifest write, no transaction log, no hook backup.
- **Transaction log at `.joinery/transactions/<timestamp>.json`** — every real (non-dry-run) `init` or `adopt` appends a JSON record listing every file written, every file preserved, every hook installed, and the path to any hook backup. Append-only audit trail; Joinery never modifies an existing transaction.
- **`workshop rollback`** — undoes the most recent transaction. Deletes every file the transaction wrote (unless `--keep-files`), restores hooks from the recorded backup, and removes the transaction record. Bounded to the most recent operation — for older history, use git.

New modules:
- `src/joinery/transactions.py` — `Transaction` dataclass, `write_transaction()`, `read_transaction()`, `list_transactions()`, `latest_transaction()`. JSON storage (stdlib `json`, no new deps).
- `src/joinery/rollback.py` — `rollback()` function + `NoTransactionError`. Restores hooks via `shutil.copy2` from the backup directory captured in the transaction.

New tests: 9 in `tests/test_transactions.py` (round-trip, chronological listing, invalid-mode rejection); 7 in `tests/test_rollback.py` (init + adopt rollback, hook restore, user-file preservation, --keep-files, graceful handling of already-deleted files); 5 in `tests/test_adopt.py` and `tests/test_init.py` combined (dry-run produces no writes, transaction log written on real runs).

CLI changes:
- `workshop init` and `workshop adopt`: new `--dry-run` flag.
- `workshop rollback` (new subcommand): `--path P`, `--keep-files`, `--yes` (skip confirmation).
- Adoption summary now uses "Would write" / "Would preserve" verbs under `--dry-run` and prints "Dry run complete — re-run without --dry-run to apply."

### Added — `workshop diff` + `workshop update`

The payoff for the answer-file foundation: Joinery can now detect and apply drift between a project's managed files and the framework's current templates.

- **`workshop diff`** — read-only. For every rendered file Joinery manages (CLAUDE.md, plan.md, AGENTS.md, HANDOVER.md, README.md, learning/, ADR, `.workshop/config.toml`), compares the on-disk content against what the current templates would produce. Prints per-file status (clean / drifted / missing) and a unified diff per drifted file. Also surfaces `joinery_version` bumps (manifest version → current).
- **`workshop update`** — apply pending drift. Walks the diff, writes the freshly-rendered template content for each drifted or missing file, refreshes `.workshop/answers.toml` to record the current Joinery version, and appends a new transaction log entry. Supports `--dry-run`, `--yes`, and `--path`.

**Stable diff context.** Time-based template variables (`init_at`, `date`, `last_session_end`, `week`) are pinned to the manifest's `created_at` during diff, so the report shows real drift (template content changes, version bumps) rather than noise from clock movement. To make this work, `init` and `adopt` now both pass `ctx["init_at"]` as the manifest's `created_at` so the value rendered into the project's files matches the value the diff reads back.

**Scope.** Drift detection covers RENDERED files only. Non-rendered managed files (hooks, skills, `.workshop/usage.jsonl`, `.workshop/tier.lock`, `.workshop/answers.toml`) are excluded — they don't carry template content. Preserved (user-owned) files are never touched.

New modules:
- `src/joinery/diff.py` — `DiffReport`, `FileDiff`, `diff_managed_files()`, `render_managed_state()`, `NotAdoptedError`. Uses stdlib `difflib.unified_diff`.
- `src/joinery/update.py` — `UpdateResult`, `apply_updates()`. Writes managed-file updates, refreshes the manifest, appends a transaction.
- `src/joinery/templates.py`: new public helper `render_template_file()` for diff/update flows that need rendered content without filesystem writes.

CLI changes:
- `workshop diff [--path P]` — new read-only subcommand.
- `workshop update [--path P] [--dry-run] [--yes]` — new subcommand. Confirms before writing unless `--yes`.

New tests: 7 in `tests/test_diff.py` (clean state, user edit detection, missing file, non-rendered file exclusion, stable time context, render_managed_state coverage), 9 in `tests/test_update.py` (no-op, drift application, missing-file restoration, dry-run, transaction recorded, manifest version refresh, --only filter, diff-update round-trip).

Internal: `transactions.write_transaction()` now uses microsecond-precision timestamps in filenames so two transactions in the same second (e.g., init then update) produce distinct files.

### Tests

18 new tests in `tests/test_adopt.py` (adopt), 8 in `tests/test_manifest.py` (round-trip + edge cases), 16 in `tests/test_preadopt.py` (safety scan + backup), 9 in `tests/test_transactions.py` (audit log), 7 in `tests/test_rollback.py` (undo flow), 7 in `tests/test_diff.py` (drift detection), 9 in `tests/test_update.py` (apply drift), and 3 additions each to `test_init.py` and `test_adopt.py` covering answer-file content + marker presence. Full suite now 133 passing (was 42 at v0.1.0).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-10

First pre-alpha release. The complete v1 framework: templates, skills, hooks, and the workshop CLI. Built from a 2000-line design specification and dogfooded on itself (production-tier discipline applied from the first commit).

### Added — workshop CLI

Python click-based command-line tool, installable via `pip install -e .` (or `pipx install joinery-cli` once published).

- `workshop init <name>` — scaffold a new project (interactive or flag-driven). Reads tier-variant templates, renders Jinja2 placeholders, installs hooks, copies skills, initializes git, makes initial commit.
- `workshop session start` — reads HANDOVER, runs preflight (git status, plan freshness on production), prints session-start summary.
- `workshop session end` — frames the session-end ritual; agent-driven steps via `workshop-session-end` skill.
- `workshop promote <project> --to <tier>` — additive scaffold upgrade (sketch → standard → production). Refuses demotion.
- `workshop doctor` — verifies workshop + project health (config, hooks, sync state, plan freshness).

Modules in `src/joinery/`: cli, init, session, promote, doctor, lang, config, templates, git, paths. Dependencies: click, jinja2. Python 3.11+.

42 pytest tests passing. mypy --strict clean. ruff check + format clean.

### Added — 23 skills

Composable markdown skill files in `skills/`. Auto-invoke from natural language for most; manual-only for `rule`, `audit`, `security-review` where intentionality matters; hook-fired or composed for the rest.

- Planning (6): `plan` (orchestrator, leverages Claude Code plan mode), `plan-system`, `plan-data`, `plan-flows`, `plan-decisions`, `plan-side-quests`
- Workflow (7): `mark`, `explain-back`, `handover`, `review`, `security-review`, `adr`, `pr`
- Discipline (4): `rule`, `sq`, `audit`, `digest`
- Documentation (4): `docs`, `docs-changelog`, `docs-getting-started`, `docs-architecture`
- Session (2): `workshop-session-start`, `workshop-session-end`

Audit-first applied — `/review` and `/security-review` adopt Claude Code's built-in skills as the priority path (engine order: roborev > Claude Code built-in > Claude subprocess fallback).

### Added — 4 git hooks

Bash scripts in `hooks/` that `workshop init` installs into `.git/hooks/` of scaffolded projects.

- `pre-commit` — lint + type-check on staged files + AGENTS.md mirror from CLAUDE.md
- `pre-push` — refuses direct main pushes on production; reads `reviews/` for critical findings
- `commit-msg` — Lore Protocol structure on production-tier commits over threshold; bot author bypass
- `post-merge` — preflight refresh + quick lint surface

Each hook under 50 lines of code. `set -euo pipefail` everywhere. Tier-aware via `.workshop/config.toml`. The 5th hook (post-commit, adversarial review) is managed by [roborev](https://github.com/roborev-dev/roborev) when installed.

### Added — 15 project templates

Static markdown and TOML templates in `templates/` with Jinja2 `{{var}}` placeholders, rendered by `workshop init` against project-specific values.

- Project-level: `CLAUDE.md.starter` (5-rule starter), `plan.md.template`, `HANDOVER.md.template`, `README.md.template`, `AGENTS.md.template`
- Workshop-level: `CLAUDE.md.global` (10 default rules)
- Tier configs: `framework.config.toml.production`, `.standard`, `.sketch` (reflecting spec §14 defaults)
- Learning module: side-quests, skills-log, comprehension-audits, ratio-log (empty), weekly-digest
- Tier-selection ADR: `0001-tier-selection.md.template`

### Added — design + documentation

- Full design specification at `docs/spec.md` (~2000 lines, 18 sections)
- 1-page architecture summary at `docs/architecture.md`
- First ADR: tiers as risk profiles, not project categories
- 5-rule starter `CLAUDE.md` (production tier)
- Dogfooded `plan.md` (Joinery's own build plan)
- Minimal OSS hygiene: CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY
- `.gitattributes` for cross-platform LF normalization

### Known limitations

- `workshop setup` not yet implemented (the doctor reports `~/.config/joinery/ MISSING` and tells you to run setup; the command lands when first needed)
- External sync adapter pattern is spec'd but no skeleton ships yet
- No GitHub Actions CI workflow; lint + typecheck + tests run locally only
- Cross-platform CI testing deferred — Windows verified, Linux relies on pure stdlib + click + jinja2 portability
- Deeper audit of `obra/superpowers` deferred to first real dogfood
